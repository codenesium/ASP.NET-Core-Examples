This project is about a new bank system you've been hired to implement. 
Your task is to create an API to create accounts. There is another service which customers interact with.
It runs the website. But your service is on the backend and actually creates the account. The service that
runs the website will call your service when an account is created. 

Create a method that accepts an account name and a global customer id and then validates and creates the account.

Glocal customer id is a nationwide identifier for all citiaens that the government uses for tracking.

As in all systems the requirements are going to change.
